# ECE4078 Practical Week 06

This week we will cover visual learning. Instruction on how to install the required libraries are provided in the Practical06_VisualLearning.ipynb notebook.

**Please make sure to install all the required libraries and test the code before the lecture**

## Coding Exercises

You will be asked to implement a convulutional network for the classification of the MNIST dataset.

## Submission

- You should submit a copy of this week's notebook (with your solution) and your trained network before Monday Sept. 14th 11:55pm. Submissions will be done through Moodle.
- Instructions on how to save a trained network are provided in the notebook
- Your submision must follow these naming conventions: [Student_ID]_Practical06.ipynb and [Student_ID]_ConvNet.pt. If you do not respect this convention, your submission will not be marked.
- **Please make sure to set the ``RUN_TRAINING`` and ``FLAG_GPU`` flags to ``False`` before submitting your solution.**


## Marking:
- All programming exercises will be graded automatically. Please make sure to not change the names of the functions or variable that indicated to be necessary for the grading
-**You will be graded based on the architecture and performance of your network (6 pts max.)**:
    - You will receive a total of 3pts if your architecture is correct.
    - You will receive 1 pt if the accuracy of your network is less than 60%.
    - You will receive 2 pts if the accuracy of your network is more than 60% but less than 95%.
    - You will receive 3 pts if the accuracy of your network is above 95%.
