# ECE4078 Practical Week 02

This week we will cover the kinematic models of mobile robots

## Coding Exercises

In this week practical notebook you will be asked to complete 3 flux questions (3 pts) and 3 programming exercises:
- Exercise 1 (2 pts) asks you determine the location of the front wheel of a bicycle model in the world frame.
- Exercise 2 (2 pts) asks you extend the bicycle kinematic model to receive velocity and steering angle rates as control inputs.
- Exercise 3 (3 pts) asks you to implement the kinematic model of a differential-drive mobile robot.

We have included test cases for all exercises.

## Submission

- You should submit a copy of this week's notebook (with your solutions) by Friday 11:55pm at the latest. Submissions will be done through Moodle.
- Details about the expected outputs are provided in the notebook.
- Your submision must follow this naming convention: [Student_ID]_Practical02.ipynb 

## Marking:
